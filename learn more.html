            <h1>Here's is a little about us.</h1>
        <p class="p-welcome">In the bustling lights of the digital realm where platforms and pixels converge, two long-time friends embarked on a mission that transcended norms and redefined connections. </p>
        
        <p class="p-welcome">Meet Luke and Thomas, two ambitious young entrepreneurs. Luke is a master in high-ticket sales and marketing, and Thomas has expertise in web development and marketing. They embarked on a mission that would reshape the landscape of the modeling industry. </p>
        
        <p class="p-welcome">Both had once been exposed to traditional modeling agencies, witnessing firsthand the exploitation and lack of respect and agency that many models faced, especially those in the OnlyFans industry.
        </p>
        
        <p class="p-welcome">As their efforts to make change gained momentum, they witnessed the emergence of a community united by a shared sense of purpose: models who found solace in knowing they had allies who championed their rights to celebrate their authenticity. </p>
        
        <p class="p-welcome"> Their journey was not without its challenges. In a landscape often marred by exploitation and superficial transactions, they faced skepticism and resistance. But fueled by unwavering determination, they pushed on. </p>
        
        <p class="p-welcome">With each step, they sought to amplify the voices often silenced by stigma and judgment. They listened intently to the aspirations and concerns of creators, forging bonds based on mutual respect and transparency. Through tireless advocacy, they sought to dismantle barriers and pave the way for a new era of model-to-agency relationships. ~ Since 2021.</p>
